        <p>Samoyed make exceptional therapy dogs and are innately gentle with children and senior citizens alike. Historically kept in the their nomadic owners' animal-skin chums (teepee-like tents), Samoyeds thrive with close human contact. It is not a breed that does well kept apart from the human family. The Samoyed is a breed of medium-sized herding dogs with thick, white, double-layer coats. They are a spitz-type dog which takes its name from the Samoyedic peoples of Siberia. Descending from the Nenets Herding Laika, they are a domesticated animal that assists in herding, hunting, protection and sled-pulling.Samoyeds can be strong-willed at times, but above all they remain friendly, gentle, and devoted family dogs. They're affectionate with almost everyone, so long as new people don't mind some shedding and stray hairs on their clothes.</p>
        <p>It's known as the "Sammy smile," the slight, but discernible, upturned corners of the Samoyed's mouth. This is a happy, good-natured dog with a glass half-full attitude toward life and the people he lives with. The Samoyed's fondness for humans probably stems from his close association with the Samoyede (now know as the Nenetsky) people who bred and raised him thousands of years ago on the Taimyr Peninsula of Siberia. The dogs pulled sleds, herded reindeer, hunted game, and protected the Samoyede against predators. The dogs also lived with the people, played with the children (which he still enjoys), and helped keep them warm in the cold climate.</p>
