                <h2>All About Pomeranians</h2>
                <p>Pomeranians, also more commonly called Poms, belong in a breed of dog that's known as the Spitz. Specifically though, Pomeranians are thought to have descended from the German Spitz. Pomeranians were named after the Pomerania region located in north-west Poland and north-east Germany. Pomeranians became popular after many of them were owned by royals since the 18th century.</p>
                <p>Pomeranians have been described as the ideal companion. They are playful, lively, smart, energetic, curious, bold, and sassy. They also have a very big-dog attitude despite their small size. Pomeranians are known for their personality but they are also known for their long and shiny coat and fox-like face. They are classified as a toy breed dog due to their small size. However, they are the most popular toy breed.</p>
